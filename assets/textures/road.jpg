The file /accident-detection-visualization/accident-detection-visualization/assets/textures/road.jpg is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, you will need to provide or create a suitable road texture image for your project. 

Please ensure that you have a road texture image saved as "road.jpg" in the specified directory.
